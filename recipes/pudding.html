    <p>Easy-to-make homemade chocolate pudding.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups whole milk, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup milk and cornstarch in a small bowl. Whisk or stir with a fork until smooth and all lumps have been incorporated.</li>
        <li>Combine remaining milk with sugar in a medium saucepan over low heat. Slowly whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Cook, whisking as needed to prevent lumps from forming, until mixture begins to thicken, 8 to 10 minutes. Add chocolate chips and salt. Continue stirring until chips are completely melted and pudding is smooth and thickened, about 7 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Pour pudding into 1 large bowl or 6 individual bowls. Place plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming; smooth it gently against the surface. Refrigerate for at least 3 to 4 hours before serving.</li>
    </ol>
